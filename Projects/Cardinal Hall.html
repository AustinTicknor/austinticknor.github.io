      <h3>Design Concept</h3>
      <p>
        The vision of our structure is centered around the concept of a compass. A timeless tool of orientation, 
        the compass has guided humanity for centuries—both physically and metaphorically. It is also a symbol shared 
        by the disciplines of engineering, interior design, and architecture, which this building seeks to unite. 
        Inspired by its form and function, our project aspires to orient students and faculty toward collaboration, 
        innovation, and professional growth.

      <h3>Context and Campus Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Located adjacent to the Texas Tech University library and student union, Cardinal Hall is designed to bring 
        together students from across disciplines within a modern environment that respects the campus's Spanish Renaissance 
        architectural heritage. The building offers a balance between tradition and innovation—integrating transparency, 
        sustainability, and spatial adaptability to promote connection with the surrounding campus.
      </p>

      <h3>Floor Plans</h3>

        <img src="../Images/Project4/FirstFloor.jpg" alt="First Floor Plan">
        <img src="../Images/Project4/SecondFloor.jpg" alt="Second Floor Plan">
      </div>
      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="../Images/Project4/ThirdFloor.jpg" alt="Third Floor Plan">
        <img src="../Images/Project4/FourthFloor.jpg" alt="Fourth Floor Plan">
      </div>

      <h3>Program and Spatial Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        This structure fosters interdisciplinary collaboration by offering a mix of open office layouts, flexible studio 
        spaces, and private work areas suited for individuals and teams. Its multifunctional design ensures that each discipline's 
        needs are met through dedicated, adaptable workspaces. Workshops for concrete, metal, and wood fabrication, along with 
        a print lab and tech-focused rooms supporting virtual reality and programming, equip students with vital hands-on 
        resources and emerging technologies.
      </p>

      <h3>Elevations</h3>

        <img src="../Images/Project4/SouthElevation.jpg" alt="South Elevation">

        <img src="../Images/Project4/WestElevation.jpg" alt="West Elevation">
      </div>

      <h3>Connectivity and Circulation</h3>
      <p>
        At the heart of the center are conference and presentation rooms that support academic collaboration and faculty engagement. 
        Student amenities are integrated throughout to encourage productivity and strengthen the community atmosphere. The layout 
        of the building emphasizes connection—both between students and between this space and its adjacent campus structures—ensuring 
        a seamless flow within the academic environment.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Code and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond conceptual intent, the design adheres to the 2021 International Building Code (IBC). The project falls under 
        Assembly Group A-3 and Business Group B, while the café is classified under Assembly Group A-2. Per IBC 602.1, the building 
        construction type is compliant, and all indoor rooms will be fully sprinklered, excluding outdoor areas. The building is ADA 
        accessible, and all design solutions respect the historic designation required by Texas Tech’s campus code.
      </p>

      <h3>Final Model</h3>

      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>
        By applying code criteria strategically, the design not only meets but exceeds safety and accessibility standards. 
        The Compass Collaborative Center ultimately serves as both a symbolic and functional tool—guiding students toward a shared 
        future of innovation, community, and professional success.
