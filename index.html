        Hello, my name is Austin Ticknor. This portfolio showcases selected works from
        my academic and professional experiences. I am currently completing my Bachelor’s degree
        in Architecture at Texas Tech University, and plan to pursue my Master’s degree
        upon graduation. As an aspiring architect, my aim is to positively impact peers, clients,
        and the broader community through thoughtful and meaningful design.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Austin Ticknor. My journey into architecture began with a pivotal moment: winning first place in a Technology Student Association competition. This achievement inspired me to pursue architecture as my major and set me on the path I'm on today.
            My first professional experience came from helping my dad remodel his office kitchen. I modeled the space in Revit and created drawings for contractors, giving me a practical introduction to the design and construction process.
            In Fall 2024, I collaborated with fellow architecture and interior design students to create Cardinal Hall. This project underscored the importance of teamwork and gave me a deeper understanding of practical design, code implementation, and the real-world impact of architecture.
            Working at Williams Tharp Architecture from January 2024 to March 2025 further honed my skills. I gained extensive experience with Revit and Twinmotion, and learned how an architecture firm operates, solidifying my commitment to the field.
            Ultimately, my goal is to create architecture that benefits the lives of those who experience it. I believe architecture plays a pivotal role in shaping community culture, and my faith in Christ motivates me to design spaces that foster a sense of community and well-being. I strive to blend traditional values with the beauty of nature, creating timeless and inspiring designs that are bigger than myself.
